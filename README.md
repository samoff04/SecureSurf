## 🧪 How It Works (Logic Overview)

When a user enters a URL, SecureSurf simulates phishing detection by evaluating:

- **Domain Analysis** – Checks for suspicious or misleading domain names.
- **HTTPS Validation** – Verifies whether the URL uses HTTPS.
- **Blacklist Keyword Matching** – Scans for common phishing-related terms (e.g., "login", "secure", "verify").
- **URL Length Check** – Flags overly long URLs, which are often used to mask malicious intent.
- **Risk Scoring** – Based on the combined analysis, a score is calculated and shown as Low, Medium, or High Risk.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a **simulation**. It does not perform real-time phishing detection or use machine learning. Intended for demo and educational purposes.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements (Planned)

- 🌐 Real-time phishing detection using a backend + ML model
- 📊 Dashboard to display history of scanned URLs
- 🧠 Integration with a trained ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- 🧾 User registration & authentication system
- 🔌 Backend via **Flask** / **Node.js**
- ☁️ Database (MongoDB / Firebase) to store scan results

# 🧠 Future Improvements

- 🔍 Add **real-time scanning** of page content  
- 🧩 Integrate **browser extension** version  
- 🤖 Enhance **ML-based detection** accuracy  
- 🗃️ Add **database** for phishing URL logging
